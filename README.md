- There is a readme for the components of the simulator [here](Crowd Simulator and Tbana Reconstruction/Assets/CrowdSimulator/README.md)
- There is a template scene, which you can use as a basis for your own project, `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Scenes/Template.unity`
- There are sample scenes in `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Scenes`.
- Prefabs needed for the simulation can be found in `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Prefabs`.
- Please use the agent models in `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Prefabs/Agents`.
